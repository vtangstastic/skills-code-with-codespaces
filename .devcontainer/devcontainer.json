// What are development containers? Development containers, or dev containers, are Docker containers that are specifically configured to provide a fully featured development environment. Whenever you work in a codespace, you are using a dev container on a virtual machine.
// A dev container file is a JSON file that lets you customize the default image that runs your codespace, VS code settings, run custom code, forward ports and much more!
